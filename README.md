This is a git repository for a project given as a task for internship selection process by Hexadecimal Software.

This project consists of a backend that sends back data that is being fetched from an api, and then being sent to when called by the frontend. React hooks have 
been used to make the process easier. The frontend consists of simple antdesign components which is one of the best frontend libraries that help create amazing
react projects. This project only uses simple hoverable cards consisting of the data fetched from the api.

run command - npm run dev - in the root folder that will run both backend and the frontend on the same time. React will run on port:3000 and backend on port :1902.
concurrently library has been used to run both the backend and the frontend with a single command.

thank you.
